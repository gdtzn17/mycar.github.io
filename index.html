        <p>Hi everyone and welcome to my garage. In here, I'll be posting pictures and progress of my car that I am working on. I put so much <em>emphasis</em> on aesthetics to make it more "European" as well as tweaking the performance. Its a way on how to impress other <b>enthusiasts</b> within the car community. I have some experience on working and repairing my car but I let my mechanic friends to deal with the heavy work, such as suspension, engine, electronics, etc. Unfortunately, funding for this project can be an issue.</p>
